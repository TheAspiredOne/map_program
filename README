This code will draw the shortest path from the starting point to the destination 
point selected on a map using the arduino. 

Here is the required wiring for the Arduino

AdaFruit Display:

    Display Pin     Arduino Mega Pin         
    1 GND           BB GND bus
    2 Vcc           BB Vcc (+ive) bus
    3 RESET         Pin 8
    4 D/C           Pin 7
      Data/Command
    5 CARD_CS       Pin 5
      Card Chip Select 
    6 TFT_CS        Pin 6
      TFT/screen Chip Select
    7 MOSI          Pin 51
      Master Out Slave In 
    8 SCK (Clock)   Pin 52
    9 MISO          Pin 50
      Master In Slave Out 
    10 LITE         BB Vcc (+ive) bus
      Backlite

Zoom in and out buttons:

    Turn on pullup resistors.
    Insted of connecting the buttons between the input pin and ground, use
    the debounce circuit as per

http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~c274/web/ConcreteComputing/section/interrupts.htm

    That is, 
    1. use a 560 Ohm (Grn Blu Red) resistor to connect one side of the button
        to GND
    2. connect the other side of the button to the input pin on the Arduino
    3. connect a 1 uF capacitor between the input pin on the Arduino and GND

    Button          Arduino Mega Pin
    Zoom In         Pin 3
    Zoom Out        Pin 2

Joystick connections:
    
    Turn on pullup resistor

    Joystick Pin    Arduino Mega Pin
    Vcc             Vcc
    GND             GND
    Horizontal      Analog 0
    Vertical        Analog 1
    Button          Pin 4

    Modified version that debounces the button:
    Button --- 560 Ohm Resistor ---|--- 1 uF capacitor --- GND
                                   |
                                   Pin 4


instructions for using the program:


1. make upload into the arduino all files in the client directory
2. navigate to the server directory run the server.py file (python3 server.py)
3. using the joystick and the lcd screen on the arduino, select
your desired starting point and destination point
4. momentarily after selecting those 2 points, the arduino will print the 
shortest path there from waypoint to waypoint.
